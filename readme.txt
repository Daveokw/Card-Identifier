Card Identifier is a fun little Streamlit app that helps you figure out what kind of playing card you're looking at — just by uploading a picture.
Behind the scenes, it uses a ResNet18 deep learning model trained on 53 different card types. You don’t need to know anything about machine learning — just upload a card image, and the app takes care of the rest: resizing it, running it through the model, and showing you the predicted card label in a snap.
It’s fast, lightweight, and built to showcase how AI can be used in a simple, everyday way.
